idea: giving users suggestions for holiday locations based on specific categories that they select

Name: Vacation Location Finder or VacaLoca

user stories:
1. as a user I want to find (inspiration for) new vacation locations

2. as a user I want to see where I could find accomodation close to the new vacation location

3. as a user I want to be able to save the locations that I like

4. as a user I want to be able to see other user's chosen/liked locations

5. as a user I want to be able to comment on a location

!!!adjust db so that it can facilitate user <-> user, many-to-many relations


business logic:
1. On a search page, make a set of categories available for the user to select like proximity to e.g. a beach, a hotel, a forest, a mountain peak, a museum, etc.. Then using my local database of everything, the server will return a selection of locations that have all selected categories within a specified range. submitting the form will lead the user to the results page where a list of location cards are present. when a user clicks on one of the results, it will show a details page of the location with the categories that were chosen, maybe information of the town its in, a map that shows the respective category instances.

2. some booking.com api data that will show available hotels and their prices (perhaps on the details page).

3. each result has a heart button that will toggle the location to be in/out the user's favorites list. there is also a favorites page that has all liked locations listed 

4. a discover page link in the navbar leads to a discover page that shows a selection of the website's users' most favorited locations. And when clicking on a user it's possible to see their full favorites list.
